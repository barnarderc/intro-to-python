## Installing Python

To install Python install the Python 3.5 version of the Anaconda Python distribution. Anaconda is an easy way to install a full scientific software stack and a good way to manage various Python packages.

To install Anaconda,

Go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads.
Choose the Python 3.5 download that matches your operating system (Windows / OSX / Linux).
Follow the instructions below the download link.
If the installer asks you to add anaconda to your path, please ensure that the checkbox is ticked.
The Anaconda Navigator allows you to add libraries, open new iPython notebooks, and work on scripts and code from a variety of python interpeters. It is an easy to use graphic interface which makes using python easy. 


This tutorial is an overview and introduction to using Python for data cleaning, analysis and visualization. It covers basic data types, creating variables, loading in datasets, and creating basic plots. This is not exhaustive and is aimed at developing a familiarity with programming in Python for the quantitative analysis in the social and hard sciences. 



## 1. What is Python?

Python is a modern, high level, open source programming language, especially useful for processing, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing data. It is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. 

There are many ways to use Python. Some options include working from the command line, executing scripts (.py files). When learning Python, Jupyter notebooks provide an easy, clean way to interact with Python, execute and write scripts, and see your results in line with the code you write. Jupyter notebooks can be accessed from your Anaconda Navigator. Jupyter notebooks are a browser based front end to Python. They allow text, graphics and can be easily run. 


To access this workshop, follow the Jupyter notebook set up in this repository:
